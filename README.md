# Serve it up, batch!

In all seriousness, this is a collection of super simple batch files that can run the current directory as a local server via python or php (named respectively).

Don't want the file? Just run the last line in either of the files in a terminal window after `cd`-ing into the desired directory. I just included this as a file because I find it easier to just double click the batch file to make the server go-go.

**NOTES:**
- The python variation requires python 3.x to be installed on your machine. If you have Python 2.x, it will require a different command (but is just as easily done)(maybe I'll add this later.?).
- The php version requires php 5.4 or greater to be installed on your machine.
