# Serve it up, batch!

In all seriousness, this is a super simple batch file that runs the current directory as a local server via python 3.x.

Don't want the file? Just run the last line in a terminal window after `cd`-ing into the directory you would like. I just included this as a file because I find it easier to just double click the batch file to make the server go-go.

**NOTE:** This does require your machine to have Python 3.x installed. If you have Python 2.x, it will require a different command (but is just as easily done).
